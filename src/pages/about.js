        <p>Hello musicians and music enthusiasts! My name is Alisha Cruz Serrano and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s of Arts in Music with a minor in acting at Texas Tech University. Music has always been a big part of my life, that’s why I chose to pursue a career in music and acting. It all started in kindergarten, music was my absolute favorite subject to study in school. Throughout my elementary years, I remember being so excited the days our extracurricular class of the day was music.</p>
  
        <p>My love for music strengthened when I went to middle school, I decided to take up the clarinet and join choir. I learned so much through my experiences in both band and choir and I can honestly say it helped shaped who I am today. Now we all remember our awkward middle school days, well music helped me get through middle school. Whenever I was upset or stress at school I always had my music classes to look forward to. I met some pretty amazing Teachers that helped shape me as a musician such as John Weeks, Stephanie Thurston, Smith, Olivia Epperson and Leah Rockwell and I am forever thankful for them. My 8th grade year my passion changed from music to medicine. The high school I was attending had a Academy for Medical Professions and I had gotten accepted.</p>
  
        <p>In high school, I now had 2 loves, music and medicine. I continued be in band and choir in high school the only difference was band became marching band and I couldn’t get enough of it! I remember waking up 6 am everyday so I could attend my 7 am practices, but I still loved it. Honestly, marching band taught me a lot about having discipline and dedication. Medicine had my heart though because I loved this idea of helping people, and I was amazed with the human body. I wanted to be a trauma surgeon because I loved fixing problems and I understood the human body very well for my age. High School was a constant struggle between me wanting to pursue medicine or music. My senior year is when music came back and stole my heart. Throughout high school choir was my favorite class, this was because of John Sikon. Mr. Sikon always made our choir class feel like family. Whenever I was upset or stressed he was the first person I talked to. Sometimes I wouldn’t even have to come to him he could tell and he would talk to me. My senior year I was uniform director for the choir and I enjoyed this position. I was able to fit students for their uniform and make sure that all uniforms were accounted for by the end of the year. But what really left a mark on me senior year was my vocal accomplishments. I was placed in the all-region choir as well as achieve honors such as a superior rating at solo and ensemble contest a long with the title of outstanding soloist. My senior year is when I discovered I excelled in singing and I loved it so it only made sense to pursue it and I did. I then applied for the Texas Tech School of Music and got accepted.</p>
  
        <p>Ever since my acceptance into the Texas Tech School of Music I’ve spent countless hours practicing so that I can achieve my goals. As of today I have performed in 2 ensembles, the Lubbock Chorale and University, and solo opportunities such as Voice Area Recital and juries. I can’t wait to see what the rest of my music journey has for me.</p>
